    "\n",
    "- Test Type: ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)\n",
    "  - Compares the mean Total Claims across multiple provinces.\n",
    "- F-Statistic: 5.849\n",
    "  - Indicates significant variation in Total Claims between provinces.\n",
    "- p-Value: 1.6782e-07\n",
    " - This value is much smaller than the common significance level of 0.05 indicating that the observed differences are statistically significant.\n",
    "- Decision: Reject the null hypothesis (H₀).\n",
    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "There is sufficient evidence to conclude that significant risk differences exist across provinces. The variations in Total Claims are statistically significant and not due to random chance.\n",
    "#### Implications\n",
    "1. Targeted Risk Strategy: Risk management or pricing strategies may need to be adjusted by province.\n",
    "2. Further Exploration: Identify specific provinces driving the differences and tailor policies accordingly.\n",
    "3. Potential Policy Adjustments: Review how premiums and policies can be aligned with the provincial risk profiles.\n",
    "#### Next Steps\n",
    "Visualize Total Claims by province to pinpoint specific regional disparities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Investigate other factors contributing to the risk differences between provinces."
